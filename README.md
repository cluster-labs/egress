## Egress

> Egress aims to become an infrastructure utility.

It uses IPFS Cluster for orchestration of the pinset and managing the peers. 
The functions for managing peers and data are exposed by the IPFS Cluster, which can be utilized by a GUI like [**Horizon**](https://github.com/cluster-labs/horizon) for a better experience.
